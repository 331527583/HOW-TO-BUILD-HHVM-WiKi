This build process is based on non-internet access environment, which means you could not get packages through wget, and normal yum.

If you want to use script directly, please do the exact following step: 

1. Download the build scripts from github: https://github.com/jackywei/HOW-TO-BUILD-HHVM-WiKi
 which will include 2 folders: buildhhvm, gccbuild
2. Setup your own build environment:
	1> cd /home
	2> mkdir /home/dev
	3> mkdir /home/dev/centos
	4> mkdir /home/dev/centos/dependsapp
	5> mkdir /home/dev/centos/centosimage
	6> mkdir /home/dev/centos/hhvmsrc
	7> mkdir /home/dev/centos/hhvmsrc/oldcode
3. Copy buildhhvm(from github) to /home/dev/centos/
	chmod 755 buildhhvm/*.*
	chmod 755 gccbuild/*.*
4. Copy gccbuild(from github) to /home/dev/centos/
5. Download following dependency packages from website and put these in /home/dev/centos/dependsapp/
	1>bagder-curl-curl-7_27_0-67-ga90492a.zip
	2>boost_1_50_0.tar.gz
	3>libdwarf-20120410.tar.gz
	4>libevent-libevent-release-1.4.14b-stable-0-geb8122f.zip
	5>libmcrypt-2.5.8-9.1.x86_64.rpm
	6>libmcrypt-devel-2.5.8-9.1.x86_64.rpm
	7>libmemcached-0.49.tar.tar
	8>libunwind-1.0.tar.gz
	9>tbb40_20120613oss_src.tgz
6. Download following GCC and related lib packages and put these to /home/dev/centos/gccbuild/
	1>gmp-4.3.2.tar.bz2  
	2>mpfr-2.4.2.tar.bz2
	3>mpc-0.8.1.tar.gz
	4>gcc-4.6.1.tar.bz2  
7. Download CentOS6.3 OS image: CentOS-6.3-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso & CentOS-6.3-x86_64-bin-DVD2.iso. And put these to /home/dev/centos/centosimage/
8. Download hhvm code from github: https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php.git, and put the code zip which you want to build in /home/dev/centos/hhvmsrc, 
	put the old version of hhvm code zip file to /home/dev/centos/hhvmsrc/oldcode/.
9. Start to build HHVM:
	1> Upgrade related lib/tools through 1_deprpm.sh
			./1_deprpm.sh
	2> Upgrade GCC to GCC4.6.1 through 2_gcc.sh
			./2_gcc.sh
	3> unzip hhvm code to /home/dev/hiphop-php through 3_unziphhvm.sh
			source 3_unziphhvm.sh
	4> Install Dependency Lib through depends_install.sh
			./depends_install.sh
	5> Build & Install HHVM through 15_hhvm.sh
			./12_hhvm.sh
10. run hhvm --version to check if hhvm is installed ok.
